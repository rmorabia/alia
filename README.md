## Technologies Used:

* JavaScript

Both the CSS and the JavaScript are framework-free.

* Mobile-responsive
* If a YouTube trailer exists, display it
* Error catching if the request fails or if the request returns nothing

## Special Thanks

The [TMDb API](http://developers.themoviedb.org) is extremely open and well-documented. Without their liberal use policy, this wouldn't have been possible.

In order to make the YouTube trailer responsive, I borrowed code from [this article](https://avexdesigns.com/responsive-youtube-embed/).
